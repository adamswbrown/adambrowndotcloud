Faith is central to my life, but it's also in the small things--how we speak, how we pray, and especially how we respond when we’ve been wronged. This week at [St Andrew’s Presbyterian Church, Bangor](https://standrewsbangor.org.uk), we continued our series through the Lord’s Prayer, focusing on a challenging but essential line:

> _"Forgive us our sins, for we also forgive everyone who sins against us."_  
> -- **Luke 11:4 (NIV)**

Jesus’ teaching on forgiveness is never abstract. It's practical, relational, and deeply personal. Forgiveness is not just something we receive; it's something we extend.

# 🕊️ Forgive Everyone for Everything

Forgiveness is at the heart of the gospel. When Jesus taught His disciples to pray, He included this uncomfortable but necessary truth: if we want to live under God's forgiveness, we must be people who forgive.

## 📖 A Parable That Cuts Deep

In Matthew 18, Peter asks how many times he must forgive--seven times? Jesus replies:

> _"I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times."_ (v. 22)

Then He tells the parable of the unmerciful servant, who was forgiven a massive debt but refused to forgive someone who owed him a small amount. The warning is clear: if we withhold forgiveness, we show we’ve never truly understood the mercy we’ve received.

> _"Shouldn’t you have had mercy on your fellow servant just as I had on you?"_  
> -- **Matthew 18:33**

## 🤝 Forbearance: Grace in Real Time

> _"Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you."_  
> -- **Colossians 3:13 (NIV)**

We often talk about forgiveness, but we rarely talk about **forbearance**--the patient, gracious endurance of others’ faults and failures. Forbearance is forgiveness in progress. It’s love that chooses to wait. It’s mercy that stretches.

🪨 It means:
- Letting go of the right to retaliate  
- Choosing peace over bitterness  
- Loving when the wounds are still healing

## 🧍‍♀️ Real-Life Stories of Radical Forgiveness

### 🔹 Gavves’ Wife (2012)
After her husband was murdered on Christmas Eve, she said:
> _"Don’t give yourself permission to pine in the room of unforgiveness."_

Through tears, she chose to forgive--not because it was easy, but because she had received the grace of Jesus.

### 🔹 Richard Wurmbrand
Tortured under communism, he forgave the man who beat him.  
> _"I have forgiven you with all my heart… If I can forgive you, so can Jesus."_

These stories show us what forgiveness and forbearance look like in action--not abstract ideals, but real, costly love.

## ❤️ Forgive from the Heart

Jesus doesn’t want shallow words. He wants forgiveness "from the heart" (Matthew 18:35). Not surface-level. Not just a performance. But real, Spirit-enabled release.

This means:
- We stop replaying the offence  
- We stop wishing harm on the person  
- We entrust justice to God

> Forgiveness is not pretending it didn’t happen.  
> Forgiveness is choosing not to carry the poison of bitterness any longer.

## ✨ The Freedom of Letting Go

Unforgiveness is a heavy burden. Forgiveness is a release. It’s the freedom to live with joy again. It’s the restoration of intimacy with God.

> _"If you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins."_  
> -- **Matthew 6:15 (NIV)**

That’s not a threat--it’s a reality. Forgiveness is the evidence of a changed heart.

## 📿 A Prayer of Forbearance

> Lord,  
> You have forgiven me more than I can ever repay.  
> Teach me to forgive.  
> Teach me to forbear.  
> When the pain resurfaces, remind me of Your mercy.  
> Help me release resentment, and let love win.  
> Amen.



## 🧠 Reflection Questions

1. Who do I need to forgive today--even if they haven’t asked?
2. Where might God be calling me to show forbearance rather than frustration?
3. Am I holding on to a wound that is keeping me from intimacy with God?
4. What does forgiveness "from the heart" look like in my current relationships?
5. Have I truly grasped the depth of God’s mercy toward me?


## 📚 Scripture References

- Luke 11:4  
- Matthew 6:9–15  
- Matthew 18:21–35  
- Colossians 3:13  
- 1 John 1:9  
- Psalm 103:8–12


Forgiveness is not easy. Forbearance is not natural. But both are possible by the grace of God. If we’ve been forgiven much--and we have--then we are called to live lives marked by mercy. Lives that forgive. Lives that forbear.

> _"Forgive everyone for everything."_  
Not because they deserve it.  
Because Jesus did it first.
