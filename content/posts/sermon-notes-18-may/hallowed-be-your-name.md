Faith is an important part of my life, and at its core, trying to understand how things plug together is another key part of what makes me *me*. As part of that, I’ll be sharing sermon notes here from time to time--simple reflections and takeaways from the Sunday messages at [St Andrew’s Presbyterian Church, Bangor](https://standrewsbangor.org.uk). I hope they’ll be an encouragement and a way for me to think aloud as I follow Jesus.
