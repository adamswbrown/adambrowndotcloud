Faith is an important part of my life, and at its core, trying to understand how things plug together is another key part of what makes me *me*. Over the past few weeks, Iâ€™ve been sharing sermon notes from our current series at [St Andrew's Presbyterian Church, Bangor](https://standrewsbangor.org.uk), where weâ€™ve been walking slowly through the Lordâ€™s Prayer in Lukeâ€™s Gospel.

This post follows on from the previous reflections on *"Father, hallowed be your name"* and *"Your kingdom come,"* turning now to the next petition: *"Give us each day our daily bread."* A short and familiar phrase, yet full of meaning--an invitation to live with dependence, humility, and trust in Godâ€™s faithful provision.

# ðŸ¥– Give Us Each Day Our Daily Bread

> "Give us each day our daily bread."  
> -- Luke 11:3 (NIV)

There is something deeply human, even sacred, about bread.

Itâ€™s simple. Ordinary. Daily. Across cultures and generations, bread has represented more than just food--it has stood as a symbol of provision, of life, of survival. And when Jesus taught His disciples to pray, He didnâ€™t begin with grand ambitions or spiritual exploits. He started with this:

**"Give us each day our daily bread."**

Itâ€™s a prayer for sustenance. A prayer for enough. A prayer that reminds us we are not self-sufficient.

## A Story of Provision

The story of God providing manna in the wilderness (Exodus 16) shows us that God knows what we need and gives it day by day. He instructed His people to gather only enough for that day. No hoarding. No stockpiling. Just trust.

God was teaching them, and us, to rely on Him daily.

Some days, it was more than enough. Other days, perhaps it didnâ€™t feel like much. But it was always sufficient.

And thatâ€™s what daily bread looks like--itâ€™s not about abundance or luxury, but faithful provision from the hand of a faithful God.

## More Than Physical

Of course, Jesus wasnâ€™t only talking about food. He later said, *"I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never go hungry."* (John 6:35)

He knew our needs go far beyond the physical. We need peace. Purpose. Forgiveness. Hope. These are not found in a full cupboard or a healthy bank account. They are found in Him.

Jesus is not just the **giver** of daily bread--**He is the bread.**

## Not Just "Me"--But "Us"

Jesus teaches us to pray not just for *my* daily bread, but for *ours*. That little word "us" matters.

It reminds us to pray with others in mind. To hold the needs of our neighbours alongside our own. To remember that Godâ€™s provision is not something we cling to, but something we are called to share.

And when we have more than we need, perhaps we are meant to be the answer to someone elseâ€™s prayer for daily bread.

## Trusting, One Day at a Time

This simple line of the Lordâ€™s Prayer calls us to a radical trust:

- Not in our ability to plan or provide,  
- Not in the illusion of control,  
- But in the goodness of a Father who knows what we need--even before we ask.

Jesus doesnâ€™t invite us to pray for weekly rations or a five-year survival plan. He invites us to live **one day at a time**, depending on Godâ€™s grace and goodness in both abundance and lack.

## Reflection Questions

1. What does "daily bread" look like for you right now--physically, emotionally, spiritually?
2. Where might God be inviting you to trust Him more fully, one day at a time?
3. Can you remember a time when God's provision showed up just when you needed it?
4. How can you be part of the answer to this prayer for someone else today?
5. Are you feeding your soul daily on Jesus, the Bread of Life?
