This is the second post in the **sermon notes series on the Lord’s Prayer**, and I found this one to be particularly interesting and somewhat thought-provoking. As always, these are just simple reflections and takeaways from the Sunday messages at [St Andrew’s Presbyterian Church, Bangor](https://standrewsbangor.org.uk). I hope they’ll be an encouragement and a way for me to think aloud as I follow Jesus.

# Your Kingdom Come, Your Will Be Done: Learning to Submit Like Jesus

As we continue our journey through **Luke 11:1–4**, the focus shifts to the second and third petitions of the Lord’s Prayer: *"Your kingdom come. Your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven."* These are not just words of hope--they are words of surrender.

To pray these lines is to long for God’s reign to break into our lives, our communities, and the whole world. It is to submit to God’s authority, even when it leads through suffering or uncertainty. It is also to join Jesus in His mission to bring transformation and light into darkness.

## "Your Kingdom Come"

Jesus invites us to pray that God’s kingdom would be seen and experienced on earth. His kingdom is one of justice, mercy, truth, and peace--so unlike the kingdoms we often see around us.

But this kingdom isn’t just future. It’s **already here**, in part, through the church. And it’s **not yet** complete until Christ returns. We pray for:
- The defeat of evil and darkness.
- The advance of the Gospel across the world.
- The flourishing of local churches and transformed lives.
- The return of Christ and the fullness of His kingdom.

## "Your Will Be Done"

God’s will is perfect, sovereign, and wise. But it’s not always easy. To pray "Your will be done" is to trust God fully, even when life hurts. It’s a prayer that might lead to self-denial, sacrifice--or even suffering.

Jesus prayed this very line in Gethsemane ([Matthew 26:39](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+26%3A39&version=NIV)), surrendering to the Father’s plan that led Him to the cross. We follow His example when we say:  
> "Not my will, but Yours be done."

We also long for God's will to be done on earth as it is in heaven--perfectly, joyfully, and completely. And we ask for help to live out His will in our everyday lives.
