As always, these are just simple reflections and takeaways from the Sunday messages at &lt;a href="https://standrewsbangor.org.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">St Andrew’s Presbyterian Church, Bangor&lt;/a>. I hope they’ll be an encouragement and a way for me to think aloud as I follow Jesus.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As we continue our journey through &lt;strong>Luke 11:1–4&lt;/strong>, the focus shifts to the second and third petitions of the Lord’s Prayer: &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;Your kingdom come. Your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em> These are not just words of hope&amp;ndash;they are words of surrender.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sermon Notes - 18 May - Hallowed be your Name</title><link>https://adambrown.cloud/posts/sermon-notes-18-may/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 May 2025 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adambrown.cloud/posts/sermon-notes-18-may/</guid><description>&lt;p>Faith is an important part of my life, and at its core, trying to understand how things plug together is another key part of what makes me &lt;em>me&lt;/em>.

I’m autistic and dyspraxic, and full-time remote work has been transformative in many ways. It removes the sensory overwhelm of office spaces, reduces social masking, and gives me more control over my environment. But it also made one thing clear: the issue was never just &lt;em>where&lt;/em> we work—it’s &lt;em>how&lt;/em> we work, and who the systems are built for.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why I Use Netlify Redirects (and Not Hugo's)</title><link>https://adambrown.cloud/posts/netlify-redirects/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 May 2025 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adambrown.cloud/posts/netlify-redirects/</guid><description>&lt;p>One of the most useful things I’ve done for my personal site recently is set up short, memorable URLs that redirect to the tools and platforms I use every day. For example, if you want to book a meeting with me, you can now just visit:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>/book
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>…which will redirect you to my &lt;a href="https://calendly.com/d/crsy-9v5-m4y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Calendly page&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-problem-with-hugo-redirects">The Problem with Hugo Redirects&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>At first, I tried to use Hugo’s built-in redirect system. Hugo supports redirects through a combination of page front matter and generated &lt;code>aliases&lt;/code>, but I ran into a couple of issues:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My Personal Tech Stack</title><link>https://adambrown.cloud/posts/tech-stack/my-personal-tech-stack/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 May 2024 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adambrown.cloud/posts/tech-stack/my-personal-tech-stack/</guid><description>A look at the tools I use every day to stay productive and solve problems across macOS and Microsoft ecosystems.</description></item><item><title>New Beginnings</title><link>https://adambrown.cloud/posts/new-beginnings/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2024 08:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://adambrown.cloud/posts/new-beginnings/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hi there - I&amp;rsquo;m glad you&amp;rsquo;ve found your way here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m Adam, and this blog exists for a reason that&amp;rsquo;s both personal and practical. I live with photosensitive epilepsy and dyspraxia. These conditions shape how I experience the world — sometimes in challenging ways, but often in ways that have given me unique perspectives, habits, and ways of working.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Professionally, I&amp;rsquo;ve built a career in technical consulting. I thrive in environments where I can solve complex problems, build systems that work for people, and translate technical detail into something meaningful. But it hasn&amp;rsquo;t always been easy to balance that with my own health needs. The truth is, living and working with invisible disabilities often means constantly negotiating boundaries, managing overstimulation, and finding workarounds that aren&amp;rsquo;t visible to others.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
